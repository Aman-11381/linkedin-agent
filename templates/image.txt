Generate a professional, visually appealing image for a LinkedIn post about the following topic:
Topic: {{ topic }}

Style: {{ style | default("clean, modern, professional illustration") }}

{% if description %}
Additional details: {{ description }}
{% endif %}

Requirements:
- The image should be suitable for a LinkedIn post (1200x627 or square)
- Use a clean, professional color palette
- Include minimal text if any — the image should complement the post, not repeat it
- Avoid stock-photo aesthetics; prefer diagrams, illustrations, or conceptual visuals
- Make it visually striking enough to stop someone scrolling
